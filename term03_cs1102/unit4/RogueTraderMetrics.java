 * DESCRIPTION: 
 * RogueTraderMetrics is a covert initiative dedicated to monitoring and analyzing anomalous stock market trends. 
 * The initiative was established to track and comprehend the financial implications of SCP anomalies, artifacts, 
 * and entities in the global markets. The mission of Rogue Trader Metrics is twofold: to predict potential 
 * financial crises caused by anomalous entities and to exploit market anomalies for funding the 
 * SCP Foundation's clandestine operations.
